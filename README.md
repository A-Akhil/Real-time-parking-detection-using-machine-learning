# Parking Lot Detection System using YOLOv5

This system uses the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm to detect and count the number of cars parked in a parking lot. It can be used in various scenarios such as automated parking management systems, parking lot occupancy detection, etc.

**Installation**

To use this system, you will need to have the following installed:

    Python 3.6 or higher
    PyTorch 1.7 or higher
    OpenCV
    YOLOv5

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Navigate to the parking_lot_detection directory.
    Place your input video in the input directory.
    Run the Main.py
    
**Customization**

If you wish to customize the detection settings, you can modify the main.py file. For example, you can change the confidence threshold or the path to the YOLOv5 weights file.
